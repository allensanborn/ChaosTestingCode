Build the dockerfile to get my lightly modified docker image which includes the the cluster-entrypoint.sh file. for some reason I couldn't get past a permissions issue on the file executing in the container. 

The blockade.yml was modified to take the new garbage name for the container i built. 

I couldn't get blockade to build so I created a container based off of a sample. 

Run pull-containers.sh to pull in the relevant containers. 


modify ~/.bashrc to have alias

alias blockade="docker run --rm -v \$PWD:/blockade \
-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock asanborn/blockade"
